# Sensor Data Analysis Using Accelerometer and Gyroscope

## <h2>Project Overview</h2>
<p>This project involves the analysis of sensor data collected from a wearable belt equipped with accelerometer and gyroscope sensors. The goal is to analyze, process, and interpret the motion and orientation data to extract meaningful insights. This data can be utilized for various applications such as activity recognition, motion tracking, or health monitoring.</p>

## <h2>Data Description</h2>
<p>The data used in this project is collected from two primary sensors:</p>
<ul>
    <li><strong>Accelerometer</strong>: Captures linear acceleration along three axes (x, y, z).</li>
    <li><strong>Gyroscope</strong>: Measures angular velocity across the three axes (x, y, z).</li>
</ul>
<p>The combination of these two sensors provides comprehensive information about the user’s movement patterns and orientation changes.</p>

## <h2>Objective</h2>
<p>The objective of this project is to develop an analysis pipeline that can:</p>
<ol>
    <li>Preprocess the raw sensor data.</li>
    <li>Extract relevant features from the accelerometer and gyroscope data.</li>
    <li>Implement data visualization for better understanding.</li>
    <li>Use machine learning (if applicable) to classify or predict motion patterns.</li>
</ol>

## <h2>Technologies Used</h2>
<ul>
    <li><strong>Python</strong>: Primary programming language for data analysis.</li>
    <li><strong>Jupyter Notebook</strong>: For writing, testing, and presenting the analysis code.</li>
    <li><strong>NumPy, Pandas</strong>: For data handling and preprocessing.</li>
    <li><strong>Matplotlib, Seaborn</strong>: For data visualization.</li>
    <li><strong>Sci-kit Learn</strong> (optional): For implementing machine learning models.</li>
</ul>

## <h2>Project Workflow</h2>
<ol>
    <li><strong>Data Collection</strong>: Data is gathered from accelerometer and gyroscope sensors on the wearable belt.</li>
    <li><strong>Data Preprocessing</strong>: Clean and format the raw sensor data for analysis.</li>
    <li><strong>Feature Extraction</strong>: Extract meaningful features from the sensor data to improve analysis and modeling.</li>
    <li><strong>Data Visualization</strong>: Visualize the data using charts and graphs to identify trends and patterns.</li>
    <li><strong>Model Development (optional)</strong>: Apply machine learning models to classify or predict motion patterns based on the sensor data.</li>
    <li><strong>Evaluation</strong>: Test the model’s performance and evaluate its accuracy.</li>
</ol>

## <h2>Conclusion</h2>
